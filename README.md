# RHFest Action

A reusable GitHub Action that validates the repository structure and `manifest.json` files for RotorHazard plugins. Validation runs through a shared rule engine and reports stable rule codes in local output and **GitHub-friendly annotations**.

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Schema validation for keys in `manifest.json`
- ✅ Plugin repository structure validation
  - 📁 Presence of `custom_plugins` folder
  - 📁 Presence of single plugin domain folder
  - 📄 Presence of `manifest.json` file
  - 🔁 Plugin domain folder matches the `domain` in `manifest.json`
- 🚨 GitHub Action annotations for validation errors
- ⚠️ Warning diagnostics that do not fail validation
- 🐳 Docker image for local testing (manual or pre-commit)
- 📋 Validates for example:
  - **domain** format (e.g., lowercase letters, numbers, underscores)
  - **version** [semver](https://semver.org) format (e.g., `X.Y.Z`)
  - **dependencies** using the [version specifiers](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#id5) format (e.g., `==X.Y.Z`)
  - **documentation_uri** URL format

## 🚀 How to Use

Create a file `.github/workflows/validate.yml` in your plugin repository with the following content:

```yaml
name: Validate Plugin Manifest

on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  validate:
    name: Run RHFest validation
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run RHFest validation
        uses: docker://ghcr.io/rotorhazard/rhfest-action:v3
```

## Test plugin locally

_Needs Docker installed_

RHFest is available as a [Docker image](https://github.com/RotorHazard/rhfest-action/pkgs/container/rhfest-action), which makes it easy to test locally without installing any dependencies. To test your RotorHazard plugin repository, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/repo ghcr.io/rotorhazard/rhfest-action:latest
```

## Development

How to setup the development environment.

### Prerequisites

You need the following tools to get started:

- [uv] - A python virtual environment/package manager
- [Python] 3.13 - The programming language

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install all dependencies with UV. This will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

3. Setup the pre-commit check, you must run this inside the virtual environment

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

4. Run the application

```bash
uv run python -m rhfest.core
```

RHFest validates the current directory outside GitHub Actions and Docker. Set
`GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to validate another path using the same discovery behavior as
the action. A run exits with status `1` when it contains one or more error
diagnostics; warnings alone exit with status `0`.

### Run tests

```bash
uv run --group dev pytest
```

The test suite covers the rule engine, repository discovery, manifest schema,
reporting, and exit status. CI runs it on all supported Python versions.

## Rule engine

Every finding is represented as data with a stable code, severity, message,
family, and optional repository-relative path, one-based line, and one-based
column. Rules return these diagnostics without writing logs themselves. The
engine sorts registered rules by phase, order, and code, executes applicable
rules, and passes the collected result to one reporter.

The rule families are:

- `STRxxx` — repository and plugin structure
- `MANxxx` — `manifest.json` loading and validation
- `RHxxx` — reserved for future RotorHazard-specific Python rules

See the [rule catalog](docs/rules.md) for the stable code mapping, detailed rule
behavior, diagnostic formats, and instructions for adding a rule.

### Run pre-commit checks

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To manual run only on the staged files, use the following command:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run
```

### Test Docker image

To build the Docker image locally, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t rhfest-action:latest .
```

To run the Docker image, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/repo rhfest-action:latest
```
